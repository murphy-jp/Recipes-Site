    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Into a small bowl, combine 15 grams of cayenne pepper, 10 grams each of Aleppo pepper and ground coriander, and 15 grams of red pepper flakes that have been ground in a spice grinder. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Set aside 3 tablespoons for the curly fries. Turn the rest into a dry brine for the chicken by adding 15 grams of kosher salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Using 1 whole chicken, cut into the classic 10 piece fried chicken pieces. </li>
        <li>Load the pieces onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and generously sprinkle on all sides with the dry-brine mixture. Place in the fridge uncovered for 4-24 hours. </li>
        <li>For the batter, in a medium bowl combine 100 grams each of all-purpose flour and cornstarch, an optional sprinkle of the spice mixture, 250 grams of water, 30 grams of vodka, and 2 large eggs. Whisk together until a pancake batter consistency is reached. Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours. </li>
        <li>Using the batter, along with a pie pan of flour, dunk each piece of chicken into the flour followed by the batter making sure each piece is thoroughly coated. Rinse and repeat for all chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>In a 375°F pot of frying oil, carefully place the chicken pieces into the oil (facing away from you, no splashes!) and frying 7-10 minutes depending on the size of the piece. Turn every other minute or so to make sure no scorching is developing. Once golden brown and 175-185°F for dark meat, 165°F for white meat, remove.</li>
        <li>Drain and cool on a paper towel-lined baking sheet before serving.</li>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Start by removing seeds and stems from chilies and cut them into 1 inch pieces. Place into dry fry pan and toast on a medium high heat until smoking slightly and fragrant.</li>
        <li>While pan is still hot add 1 ½ cups of chicken stock and bring to a bare simmer, cover and remove from heat and allow to steep for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the pepper mixture in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times before adding ½ cup of corn flour for thickening, 1 Tbsp dried oregano, 2 Tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1 Tbsp ground cumin. Process that for about 2 minutes or until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1 finely chopped habanero, 1 finely chopped jalapeno, 1 chopped onion and 1 clove of garlic, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Take Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman and cut into ½-inch pieces along with squeezing a pound of uncured chorizo out of it’s casing.</li>
        <li>Brown the chorizo over a medium high heat, rendering out all the fat, and breaking into small pieces. Remove chorizo and add pork shoulder to the brown in the sausage fat.</li>
        <li>Remove pork shoulder and add our chopped vegetables. Once vegetables are cooked, deglaze with a full Mexican beer.</li>
        <li>Scrape all the good stuff off the bottom of the pot, add our spice paste, another 1 ½ cups of chicken stock, and (2) 14 ounce cans of chopped tomatoes, along with our meat back into the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir and partially cover and let simmer for 3-4 hours on a low heat until meat is fully cooked and the sauce is thickened. Add salt and pepper for taste.</li>
